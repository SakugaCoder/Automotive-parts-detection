# Automotive-parts-detection
Classification of automotive parts in realtime using a **CNN** model created with **tensorflow** in **python**
with two **GUI**, one made with **tkinter** and **open cv** (For desktop aplication) and the other with **HTML**,
**JavaScript**, **CSS** and **Flask** (For web application). The desktop program also provides functionality to clasify 
parts from a source and save the image that was clasified from the realtime prediction in order
to use in the future. The model is able to clasify 10 automotive parts with an accuracy of **77%**.

When the program finds the class which the part belong, the UI enables a button that opens a browser
and shows a map with automotive parts shops related to the user location (In the web app this map is 
displayed in the same page of the results). All of this made using **Google Maps API** in **JavaScript**.
